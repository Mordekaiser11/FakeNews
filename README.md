# FakeNews

Fake news detection by using random dataset.

First of all,there are bunch of instances in the whole existance so we feel free to choose.
We applied passive - aggressive classifier to comb out which was negative or positive in English.
This is a basic example to grab how to handle datasets for Natural Language Processing tasks.
All other splitting and fitting operations are obvious.
